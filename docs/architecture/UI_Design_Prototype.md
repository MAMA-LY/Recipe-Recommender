### **Login Page**

    A simple design for the login/sign up page as the user can log in using his/her email and password and has the option
    to make the app remembers him/her.
    And can sign up/ log in using google or facebook account (This feature can change).

### **Home Page**

    The user can find in the home page his last visited recipes (or some recommeneded recipes if the recommendation system is built),
    and the user can click on the recipe to see its information.
    The user can go to his nutritions from the button on the upper left corner.
    The navigation bar holds the home page, meals calendar page, search page, favorite recipes page, and settings page,
    where user can navigate the app using it.

### **Search Page**

    Where the user can add the ingerdients he/she has and hit the recommendation button to see what recipes he/she cans make.
    There is cart for the search session so the user can double-check what he/she added in it.
